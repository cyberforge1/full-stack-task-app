# Frontend - React Typescript

## Tech Stack

- JSX
- SCSS
- Typescript
- React 
- Git 


## Build Steps
1. Clone the project from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:cyberforge1/task-tracker-full-stack.git

2. Create, initialize and link a MySQL database to the backend API

3. Run the backend API locally

4. Navigate to the frontend directory
   ```bash
   cd task-tracker-full-stack/frontend

5. Run the frontend locally 
   ```bash
   npm run dev

## How To Use
- Users can create a task by filling out the form inputs and submitting the 'Add Task' button. Tasks can then be completed, edited, or deleted with a button click. Features for sorting, searching and changing the user interface appearance are also available.


## Design Goals
- The objective for the frontend was to create a responsive, appealing and intuitive user interface that allows users to easily access the backend features. 


## Project Features
- [x] An efficient user interface to interact with the backend API to access CRUD functionality
- [x] Dynamic filtering for specific task status
- [x] Instantaneous searching for matching tasks 
- [x] Toggling capability between list and tile components for tasks



# Backend - Spring Boot API

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Swagger
- Log4j
- JUnit
- MySQL


## Build Steps
1. How to build/run the project (use proper code snippets)
ex.
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:cyberforge1/some-project.git
```

## How To Use

To access this backend, first follow the build steps above. The application frontend provides a user interface to interact with this backend automatically, endpoints can also be accessed and tested through an applications like Postman, or Swagger UI.

## Design Goals
- The aim of this application was to create a robust API to create, read, update and delete task data. 


## Project Features
- [x] Comprehensive CRUD functionality to interact with the database
- [x] A MySQL database to store task data  
- [x] User error notification for incorrect endpoint access
- [x] Enhanced logging features provided by Log4j
- [x] Project document generation by Spring Swagger
- [x] Unit testing provided by JUnit

# General

## Additions & Improvements
- [ ] Addition of GitHub Workflow Badges
- [ ] User authentication and login functionality
- [ ] Integration of React Testing Library for frontend
- [ ] Providing toast notifications for error handling
- [ ] Troubleshooting backend integration and end-to-end testing
- [ ] Creating a Docker container for deployment


## Learning Highlights
- Practiced and enhanced skills with React by creating components, adding display toggling, dynamic filtering and searching to my application
- Applied various tests and testing libraries to the frontend and backend
- Building in different libraries to increase application scope and functionality 
- Gained valuable experience by independently building a Spring Boot application
- Creating and integrating a MySQL database for desired data

## Challenges
- Learning how to apply unit-testing, integration testing and end-to end testing throughout the application
- Building previously unknown features into the application with new libraries
